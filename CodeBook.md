# Code book for tidy_data_mean.txt

## Overview
This data set provides the averages of the features (extracted from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset") grouped by subject and activity. It is the final product for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

## Source Dataset






## Variables

### "subject" 
Identifies the volunteer that the data is gathered from. Range is 1 to 30.

### "activity" 
Activity the subject is performing. Can be WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING

### "mean of [measurement]-[function]-[axis]"
This table contains the mean of the measurements grouped by subject and activity.

[measurement] denotes the
